``mmpack repo`` [list]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**mmpack-repo** is a tool to manage the repositories of a prefix. It mimics
the *git remote* command. A call to **mmpack-update** is required for the
changes to take effect.

**mmpack repo add** adds a repository named **<name>** pointing to the
repository at **<url>**. The comand will fail to add a repository with a name
that already exists.

**mmpack repo list** shows a list of existing repositories.

**mmpack repo remove** removes the repository named **<name>**.

**mmpack repo rename** changes the name given to a repository from
**<old-name>** to **<new-name>**.

**mmpack repo enable** makes the repository named **<name>** enabled, i.e., the
packages provided by the repository **<name>** are available after the next call
to mmpack update.

**mmpack repo disable** makes the repository named **<name>** disabled, i.e.,
the packages provided by the repository **<name>** are not available anymore.
