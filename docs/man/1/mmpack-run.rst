SYNOPSIS
========

**mmpack run** [-h|--help] [*command*]

DESCRIPTION
===========
**mmpack-run** runs given *command* within current prefix.
If no command was given, it will open an interactive shell within the current
prefix instead.

OPTIONS
=======
--help, -h
  Show help and exit

EXAMPLE
=======
.. code-block:: sh

  # create a bash shell within current prefix
  mmpack run bash


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

While a process is running in a prefix (ie children of the **mmpack-run**
command process), the following variables are set :

MMPACK_PREFIX
  Although this variable may have been set prior to **mmpack-run**, this is
  reset to the absolute path of the active prefix mounted by **mmpack-run**.
  It may however be reset again in the children of this command if, while a
  prefix is active, mmpack commands are intended to operate on a different
  prefix.

MMPACK_ACTIVE_PREFIX
  Defined to the absolute path of the active prefix. This variable is to be
  read only as an indicator of the currently mounted prefix.


NOTES
=====

You may modify your shell prompt to reflect whether a prefix is currently active
and which one. A bash script (prompt.bash) provided in the installation of mmpack
implements this and can be sourced in your bash initialization file.
