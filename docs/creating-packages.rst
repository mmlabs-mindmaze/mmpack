Generating binary packages
==========================

When building packages from a project, mmpack will create one or several
packages from the files staged for installation.
The packages declared in the mmpack specfile will receive the files according
to **files** fields specified there. The remaining files are assigned to either:

 - a main binary package
 - one package for each dynamic library
 - a devel package
 - a debug package
 - a documentation package


This process can be detailed as follows (for package "XXX"):

0. Gather all the staged files
1. Give the custom packages their requested files
2. Give files to their corresponding package based on their type.
   Create the packages as needed.

   - documentation files (man pages, sphinx outputs ...) go to ``XXX-doc``
   - debug symbols go to ``XXX-debug``
   - development files (headers, static libraries ...) go to ``XXX-devel``
   - dynamic libraries create their own packages
   - binaries, and ``.1`` man pages go to the main binary package ``XXX``

3. All the remaining files (if any) will go to a *default* package.
   The *default* package is the main binary package if there is one.
   If there is no binary package and **only one** library package,
   the default library is the library package.
   Finally, if there is no binary package, and there are multiple
   library packages, create a main binary package as host for those files.


Some filters are not explicit here because they  *should* be intuitive to
understand.
If you have an issue with they way this works, most of them are implemented in
``src/mmpack-build/file_utils.py`` should you feel up to it, otherwise contact
us and we'll try to help.


Minimal mmpack packaging example
================================

A minimal mmpack packaging example is available here [1].
It is an autotools-based hello-world project with simple commands.
It also is used as part of the mmpack continuous testing.
Feel free to fork it, and play around with it.

You can test is as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   # prepare to work on a tmp prefix
   MMPACK_REPOSITORY=http://mm-v008/mmpack/stable/debian/
   export MMPACK_PREFIX=/tmp/mmpack-hello-world-prefix

   # create a mmpack prefix
   mmpack mkprefix --url=$MMPACK_REPOSITORY $MMPACK_PREFIX

   # build mmpack-hello-world directly from git, using the top of the master
   # branch.
   mmpack-build pkg-create ssh://intranet.mindmaze.ch:29418/mmlabs/mmpack-hello-world --tag master

   # You can also clone and do the same from the project's folder:
   git clone "ssh://intranet.mindmaze.ch:29418/mmlabs/mmpack-hello-world"
   cd mmpack-hello-world
   mmpack-build pkg-create
   # This should end with telling you: "generated package: mmpack-hello-world"
   # the full name of your package should be in the line just before.

   # assuming you did not change your config, install from the created package
   # file within your home folder.
   # (on debian/x86, the * wildcard would expand into amd64-debian)
   mmpack install ~/.local/share/mmpack-packages/mmpack-hello-world_1.0.0_*.mpk

   # you can test the package by running
   hello-world
   mmpack run hello-world

   head-libexec-world  # should fail
   mmpack run head-libexec-world  # this one should work


How to create a local repository using the package I created ?
==============================================================

.. code-block:: sh

   # assuming you did not change your config, the mmpack packages are created
   # in the following folder
   PKG_FOLDER="$HOME/.local/share/mmpack-packages/"
   REPO="$HOME/mmpack-repo"
   ARCH=amd64-debian # amd64-windows for windows

   for manifest in *.mmpack-manifest
   do
      mmpack-modifyrepo --path=$REPO --arch=$ARCH add $manifest
   done

   # add the repository to your list of repositories by adding file://$REPO
   # to your mmpack config "repositories" list
   # It could look like this
   cat > ~/.config/mmpack-config.yaml <<EOF
   repositories:
     - home-repo:
        url: file:///home/gandalf/mmpack-repo
        enabled: 1
   EOF
