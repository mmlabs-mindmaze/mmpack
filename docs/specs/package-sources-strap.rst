package sources_strap structure
===============================

It is possible to separate the mmpack packaging from the actual source of the
project it package. In such a case, when generating the source tarball, the
upstream sources will be fetched and merged with mpack packaging.

name and location
-----------------

It should be called **sources-strap** and be placed within a folder named
**mmpack** at the root of the repository being packaged.  Following this naming
convention will allow mmpack to automatically find and fetch upstream source
automatically.

Format
------

The format follows the `yaml`_ format.

.. _yaml: https://yaml.org/

Mandatory fields
```````````````````

 :method:
   The method how to fetch the sources. It should be currently 'tar' or 'git'.

 :url:
   The url used to recover the upstream sources of the project.
   With 'git' method, this url is the same as the argument for ``git clone``.

Optional fields
```````````````````

 :branch:
   (for git only) The commit hash, tag or branch that must be extracted
   by git clone

 :sha256:
   (for tar only) The SHA256 hash of the tarball that must be downloaded

 :patches:
   list of patch files to applied on upstream sources after fetching them
