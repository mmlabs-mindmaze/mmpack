    This is a dummy description field for the dummy sample mmpack
    specfile. This is a multiline comment.
    This describes what sample is all about

  build-depends:
    - libmyotherlib-devel
    - libsomeotherlib-devel

  ignore: # list of files to be ignored by any package

    This will be appended to the general description field
    This also can be a huge comment.
  files:
    # any file can be given here.
    # below is the list of regex used by default
    # It also is the default package for all that is not ventilated
    # otherwise
    #
    # All regex are PCRE (to be parsed with: docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

    - .*/bin/.*
    - .*/locale/.*
    - .*/man/*\.1

  depends:
    - sample  # automatically added
  description: same
  files:
    - .*/man/.*\.(2|3)
    - .*/include/.*
    - .*\.so

    - sample  # automatically added

  description: same
  files:
    - .*\.debug  


# Additionally, packages can be generated around some files.
# For example, if the compilation of the package yields a library
# then an additional package will be generated around it.
# Eg:
# file: xxx.so.1 -> package: xxx1
# file: libsample.so.2 -> package: libsample2
#
# For projects containing both binaries and dynamic libraries,
# *two* packages will be generated.

#
# explicit custom packages
#

    This is a completely custom description.
    It will not get concatenated with the global description
  files:
    - /any/full/path/to/some.file
    - .*/anything PCRE/.*

any-other-package:
  description: this is mandatory
  files:
    - .*this is also mandatory.*
