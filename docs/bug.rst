Bug reports & Feature requests
==============================

If you have a problem with mmpack, or an idea for any new feature, please
create a github entry and assign it to Nicolas Bourdaud or send directly by email
at nicolas.bourdaud@gmail.com.

For bug reports, please include the mmpack version, the command, its output and
the resulting mmpack log file generated. If possible, try to reproduce on a
clean mmpack prefix.

Including or providing a link to the source files involved may help fixing the
issue. If possible, try to create a minimal scenario that produces the error
and post that instead.
