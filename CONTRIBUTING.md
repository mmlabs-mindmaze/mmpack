While sources are mirrored on github and issues can be open there, the main
contribution platform is
[GerritHub](https://review.gerrithub.io/admin/repos/mmlabs-mindmaze/mmpack).

All pull-requests are automatically tested on both windows and debian.  Python
files will go through pylint and pycodestyle.

Debian users can take advantage from the _git-review_ package which provides
the homonymous command, for a neat integration with Gerrit.

All contributions are welcome !
