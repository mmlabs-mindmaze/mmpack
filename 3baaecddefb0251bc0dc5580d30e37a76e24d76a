      "message": "Yes... I understand this is unfortunate, I felt it was better than changing source version. Indeed, the source have been written taking into account the project up to the version written in the specs (hence it is right that the source package is versioned at the one), but the binary package present in the system is lower hence the changed version.\n\nIf we consider that the same source tarball could be used in different distribution (packaging different version), then I think this is the right thing to do to keep the version of source as is.",
